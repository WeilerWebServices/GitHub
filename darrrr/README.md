The Delegated Account Recovery Rigid Reusable Ruby (aka D.a.r.r.r.r. or "Darrrr") library is meant to be used as the fully-complete plumbing in your Rack application when implementing the [Delegated Account Recovery specification](https://github.com/facebook/DelegatedRecoverySpecification). This library is currently used for the implementation at [GitHub](https://githubengineering.com/recover-accounts-elsewhere/).

Along with a fully featured library, a proof of concept application is provided in this repo.

## Configuration

An account provider (e.g. GitHub) is someone who stores a token with someone else (a recovery provider e.g. Facebook) in order to grant access to an account.

In `config/initializers` or any location that is run during application setup, add a file. **NOTE:** `proc`s are valid values for `countersign_pubkeys_secp256r1` and `tokensign_pubkeys_secp256r1`

```ruby
Darrrr.authority = "http://localhost:9292"
Darrrr.privacy_policy = "#{Darrrr.authority}/articles/github-privacy-statement/"
Darrrr.icon_152px = "#{Darrrr.authority}/icon.png"

# See script/setup for instructions on how to generate keys
Darrrr::AccountProvider.configure do |config|
  config.signing_private_key = ENV["ACCOUNT_PROVIDER_PRIVATE_KEY"]
  config.symmetric_key = ENV["TOKEN_DATA_AES_KEY"]
  config.tokensign_pubkeys_secp256r1 = [ENV["ACCOUNT_PROVIDER_PUBLIC_KEY"]] || lambda { |provider, context| "you wouldn't do this in real life but procs are supported for this value" }
  config.save_token_return = "#{Darrrr.authority}/account-provider/save-token-return"
  config.recover_account_return = "#{Darrrr.authority}/account-provider/recover-account-return"
end

Darrrr::RecoveryProvider.configure do |config|
  config.signing_private_key = ENV["RECOVERY_PROVIDER_PRIVATE_KEY"]
  config.countersign_pubkeys_secp256r1 = [ENV["RECOVERY_PROVIDER_PUBLIC_KEY"]] || lambda { |provider, context| "you wouldn't do this in real life but procs are supported for this value" }
  config.token_max_size = 8192
  config.save_token = "#{Darrrr.authority}/recovery-provider/save-token"
  config.recover_account = "#{Darrrr.authority}/recovery-provider/recover-account"
end
```

The delegated recovery spec depends on publicly available endpoints serving standard configs. These responses can be cached but are not by default. To configure your cache store, provide the reference:

```ruby
Darrrr.cache = Dalli::Client.new('localhost:11211', options)
```

The spec disallows `http` URIs for basic security, but sometimes we don't have this setup locally.

```ruby
Darrrr.allow_unsafe_urls = true
```

## Provider registration

In order to allow a site to act as a provider, it must be "registered" on boot to prevent unauthorized providers from managing tokens.

```ruby
# Only configure this if you are acting as a recovery provider
Darrrr.register_account_provider("https://github.com")

# Only configure this if you are acting as an account provider
Darrrr.register_recovery_provider("https://www.facebook.com")
```

## Custom crypto

Create a module that responds to `Module.sign`, `Module.verify`, `Module.decrypt`, and `Module.encrypt`. You can use the template below. I recommend leaving the `#verify` method as is unless you have a compelling reason to override it.

### Global config

Set `Darrrr.this_account_provider.custom_encryptor = MyCustomEncryptor`
Set `Darrrr.this_recovery_provider.custom_encryptor = MyCustomEncryptor`

### On-demand

```ruby
Darrrr.with_encryptor(MyCustomEncryptor) do
  # perform DAR actions using MyCustomEncryptor as the crypto provider
  recovery_token, sealed_token = Darrrr.this_account_provider.generate_recovery_token(data: "foo", audience: recovery_provider, context: { user: current_user })
end
```

```ruby
module MyCustomEncryptor
  class << self
    # Encrypts the data in an opaque way
    #
    # data: the secret to be encrypted
    #
    # returns a byte array representation of the data
    def encrypt(data)

    end

    # Decrypts the data
    #
    # ciphertext: the byte array to be decrypted
    #
    # returns a string
    def decrypt(ciphertext)

    end

    # payload: binary serialized recovery token (to_binary_s).
    #
    # key: the private EC key used to sign the token
    #
    # returns signature in ASN.1 DER r + s sequence
    def sign(payload, key)

    end

    # payload: token in binary form
    # signature: signature of the binary token
    # key: the EC public key used to verify the signature
    #
    # returns true if signature validates the payload
    def verify(payload, signature, key)
      # typically, the default verify function should be used to ensure compatibility
      Darrrr::DefaultEncryptor.verify(payload, signature, key)
    end
  end
end
```

## Example implementation

I strongly suggest you read the specification, specifically section 3.1 (save-token) and 3.5 (recover account) as they contain the most dangerous operations.

**NOTE:** this is NOT meant to be a complete implementation, it is just the starting point. Crucial aspects such as authentication, audit logging, out of band notifications, and account provider persistence are not implemented.

* [Account Provider](controllers/account_provider_controller.rb) (save-token-return, recover-account-return)
* [Recovery Provider](controllers/recovery_provider_controller.rb) (save-token, recover-account)
* [Configuration endpoint](controllers/well_known_config_controller.rb) (`/.well-known/delegated-account-recovery/configuration`)

Specifically, the gem exposes the following APIs for manipulating tokens.
* Account Provider
  * [Generating](https://github.com/github/darrrr/blob/faafda5b1773e077c9c10b55b46216f97d13cd3b/lib/github/delegated_account_recovery/account_provider.rb#L49) a token
  * Signing ([`#seal`](https://github.com/github/darrrr/blob/faafda5b1773e077c9c10b55b46216f97d13cd3b/lib/github/delegated_account_recovery/crypto_helper.rb#L13)) a token
  * Verifying ([`#unseal`](https://github.com/github/darrrr/blob/faafda5b1773e077c9c10b55b46216f97d13cd3b/lib/github/delegated_account_recovery/crypto_helper.rb#L30)) a countersigned token
* Recovery Provider
  * Verifying ([`#unseal`](https://github.com/github/darrrr/blob/faafda5b1773e077c9c10b55b46216f97d13cd3b/lib/github/delegated_account_recovery/crypto_helper.rb#L30)) a token
  * [Countersigning](https://github.com/github/darrrr/blob/faafda5b1773e077c9c10b55b46216f97d13cd3b/lib/github/delegated_account_recovery/recovery_provider.rb#L60) a token

### Development

Local development assumes a Mac OS environment with [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) available. Postgres and phantom JS will be installed.

Run `./script/bootstrap` then run `./script/server`

* Visit `http://localhost:9292/account-provider`
  * (Optionally) Record the random number for verification
  * Click "connect to http://localhost:9292"
* You'll see some debug information on the page.
  * Click "setup recovery".
* If recovery setup was successful, click "Recovery Setup Successful"
* Click the "recover now?" link
* You'll see an intermediate page, where more debug information is presented. Click "recover token"
* You should be sent back to your host
  * And see something like `Recovered data: <the secret from step 1>`

### Tests

Run `./script/test` to run all tests.

## Deploying to heroku

Use `heroku config:set` to set the environment variables listed in [script/setup](/script/setup). Additionally, run:

```
heroku config:set HOST_URL=$(heroku info -s | grep web_url | cut -d= -f2)
```

Push your app to heroku:

```
git push heroku <branch-name>:master
```

Migrate the database:

```
heroku run rake db:migrate
```

Use the app!

```
heroku restart
heroku open
```

## Roadmap

* Add support for `token-status` endpoints as defined by the spec
* Add async API as defined by the spec
* Implement token binding as part of the async API

## Don't want to run `./script` entries?

See `script/setup` for the environment variables that need to be set.
